// what is Nextjs?

// Next.js is react-framework used for building full-stack web app with feature like SSR,SSG , Api routes, img optimization and built-in routing
// Unlike plain react, next.js focuses on performnace, Seo and dev productivitu

// Key Features:
// File-based routing: every file in pages/ is route
// Rendering Options: CSR,SSR,SSG,ISR
// API-routes: Built-in api routes: pages/api/ or app/api/
// Image Optimiaztion: next/Image for responsive, lazy-loaded images
// SEO-friendly: next/head for meta tags, pre-rendered HTML on server
// Code Splitting and bundling: only load what's needed per page
// Middleware and edge fn: run logic before rendering(auth,redirect) 
// npx create-next-app my-app

// Why use next.js than react?

// - React only has CSR, which can lead to slower intial load and poor Selection
// - Next.js adds SSR,SSG making app faster and SEO-freindly
// - Next.js reduces setup complexity by providing routing, React needs react-router
// - Next.js also has API endpoints so don't need separate backend but react is frontend only lib and need separate backedn(node.js)
// - Next.js also has built-in performance optimiaztion for img,font,code but react require manual optimizaton
// - Most imp point Next.js is SEO friendly and react has poor SEO.

// Real-life Analogy:
// React is like u building a house from raw materials(u need to arrange plumbing,wiring,etc)
// Nextjs is like buying fully furnised house where all plumbing,wiring are setup)
